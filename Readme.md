## Overview

This App was made for my Android Development course. This simple expense tracking app lets the user keep track of expenses by selecting a category, picture of the receipt, amount, and name. This can then be viewed or edited. 
As a coding excercise this made use of Intents, OnClicks, Sorting, DatePickerDialog, and Validation.
